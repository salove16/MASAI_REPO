Assignment  - HR Script  

Please introduce yourself/ Why do you want to join our company?
Good morning, Sir/Maâ€™am!
Firstly, thank you for considering my application and taking the time to meet with me today. My name is Shashank Shalabh, and I hail from Patna, Bihar, currently residing in Hyderabad. I completed my B.Tech in ECE from TISL, affiliated with MAKAUT University, in 2018.
Subsequently, I began preparing for civil exams and continued this pursuit for over two years. Unfortunately, I did not achieve the expected results. During the pandemic, I discovered MASAI, which offers a 30-week course. Upon delving deeper about Masai, my interest in becoming a software developer was piqued.
Having a background in ECE, which includes Digital Electronics, a field closely related to coding, and being inherently logical, this opportunity provided me with a second chance. It inspired me to enroll in the Full Stack Web Development course at MASAI, where I have acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, React.js, Express, and JavaScript technologies.
In August 2022, I joined M2P as a Full Stack Developer at Syntizen, an M2P company located in Hyderabad. Syntizen is a fintech-based company offering microservices such as VKYC, DKYC, FRS, and INSTANT PAN to the banking and corporate sectors. Leading an internal fintech project from inception, I applied my expertise to both the front-end and back-end, creating an exhilarating experience.
Outside of work, my hobbies include music, cooking, DIY projects, gardening, and staying updated with new technologies.
In my family, there are four members, including myself. My father is a retired officer from All India Radio, Patna. My mother is a homemaker and entrepreneur managing her dairy project. Additionally, my elder sister is pursuing a Ph.D. in Marketing Finance.


(a)Why did you shift your industry or why is there a gap after graduation?
If not applicable, attempt the below question.

(b). Why did you choose to become a Software Developer?
Following my initial pursuit of civil exams over a span of two years, I regrettably did not attain the anticipated results. However, amid the pandemic, I came across MASAI, an institution offering a 30-week course. Upon further exploration of MASAI, my interest in transitioning to software development was sparked.
With a foundation in ECE, particularly Digital Electronicsâ€”a field intricately connected to codingâ€”and a natural inclination towards logic, this presented a second chance for me. Motivated by this opportunity, I enrolled in MASAI's Full Stack Web Development course, driven by a newfound aspiration to excel in the software development realm

But Unfortunately, midway through the development process, we encountered an unexpected technical hurdle related to data integration with a third-party API.
I ping everyone on slack to talk about what happened and how it might affect our deadline. We made sure to tell everyone involved, like our Project manager and stakeholder.

Once we knew how long it would take to fix, we carefully changed our plan for finishing the project. We made sure our new plan was possible and let everyone know why we made the changes.
